## This repository containts the front end code for my face and image recognition web site.
You can check out my website from this [Link](https://face-recognition-frontend-oh52.onrender.com/). However it might take a while for it to open at the first time due to the servers being inactive. Or you can download this project to your computer and run it on your local host.

## How to use it ?
Just copy an image URL and paste it into the input bar. Then choose a mod. You can either choose face detection or image recoginiton mode. You can see the results by pressing the detect button. The website will want you to login first. You can create an acount to see how many entries you have done but that's completely optional since there is a 'Try without signing in' button which allows you to use it without an account.

## How does it work ?
I'm using [clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/)'s face-detection and genereal-image-recognition algorithms. Clarifai is a company wich offers tons of AI algorithms that you can access with an API.

## How to run this site on your localhost ?
Just download this repository then

#### Run `npm install`
#### Run `npm start`

then the website will open on your local host. However since you are running it without backend you won't be able register or sign in to any account but you can still use it using the 'Try without signing in' option.
